# Mushroom Dataset Dimensionality Reduction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on applying dimensionality reduction techniques to the Mushroom Dataset. The aim is to reduce the number of features while maintaining as much information as possible, facilitating easier visualization and better model performance.

## Dataset

The Mushroom Dataset contains several categorical features describing various physical characteristics of mushrooms, with the target variable indicating whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to apply various dimensionality reduction techniques and evaluate their effectiveness in preserving the important information within the dataset.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing the data
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the distribution of features
   - Visualizing the data using various plots

3. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Comparing the explained variance ratio for PCA
   - Visualizing the clusters formed by t-SNE and LDA
   - Assessing the impact of dimensionality reduction on classification performance

## Results

The results section includes:
- **PCA**: Explained variance ratio and scree plot
- **t-SNE**: Visualization of clusters
- **LDA**: Visualization of clusters and explained variance

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings of the project, including the effectiveness of each dimensionality reduction technique in preserving the dataset's important information. Discuss any limitations and potential improvements for future work.
